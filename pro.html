      <p>Nohara Shinnosuke</p>
      <p>
        He is the <span class="span">main character</span>, son of Hiroshi and Misae and Himawari's brother, a kindergarten-aged boy whose antics are the basis for the series. His affectionate name by relatives is Shin-chan. He is five and loves chocolate biscuits of the brand "Chocobi" and a TV superhero named "Action Kamen", but he absolutely hates green peppers. He shows deep affection for his sister Himawari. He is a very good singer and pretty good baseball and football player. He learned photography from his aunt Musae. Sometimes he changes the actual words, making it very funny. For example, promise becomes promotion etc. He often exhibits deep affection for his friend Kazama. Some of his strange activities include dressing up (often as an animal). He also causes trouble for others and then criticizes their efforts in covering for him. In general, he is outspoken and very curious. He has little shame. There have been several instances in which his antics actually solved the problems of those around him. He also displays a surprising amount of talent at singing songs and changing their wordings. On rare occasions, he displays bouts of selfless kindness. For example, in one anime episode he saved a frog from a truck on a rainy day, getting all wet and dirty in the process and risking Misae's ire since it was his last set of clean clothes. In another episode, he gives Masao the change he has even though he knows that his mother will scold him later. However, these are often immediately followed by antics that negate the goodwill others feel. There are also times when Shin-chan displays a level of maturity beyond his usual self in his concern for others, and in a few rare instances he shows that deep down he really does care for his family, although he usually behaves badly with them.

      <p>Nohara Misae</p>
      <p>
        Shin-chan's mother from Tokyo. She is 29 and a typical housewife of post-war Japan: She cleans, launders, cooks, sews, mothers Shin-chan and his sister, and lazes. While at heart a caring and nurturing individual, her positive aspects are often offset by her many shortcomings. A paragon of hypocrisy, after handing out irrevocable edicts to her husband and children, she will not hesitate to immediately break them once they are out of sight. Her famous and symbolic moves includes "drilling" others' head with her fists (known as "guri-guri") and a series of punches on the head, creating comically large lumps (the punches are mainly thrown by Misae, but other characters have been known to use it as well, such as Hiroshi and even Nene). Her son often makes fun of her habitual constipation, as well as her fluctuating weight and small breasts. While she spends as little as possible on the less-essential needs of her husband and son, she loves to splurge on Himawari and herself, though she is noted to have instances of great generosity. She always changes her hair styles as seen it is sometimes curly and sometimes long and shattered hair. Most of her luxury purchases, however, often end up broken, misused or otherwise ruined by her children, sometimes even before she had a chance to try them. She is the source of boundless diet and savings plans, all of which fail within the first week or even first day. She is prone to immediately partake in bargain sales when she sees them, thinking she is saving the family money. She then buys extreme quantities, regardless of the practicality, which defeats the purpose. Additionally she secretly hoards money for her own personal use. She is also known to be a terrible driver. Misae also constantly checks Shin-chan's and Hiroshi's behavior around young women and punishes them accordingly (and always seems to be in the right place at the right time when it comes to the latter). She was born in Aso, Kumamoto.

      <p>Nohara Hiroshi</p>
      <p>
        Shin-chan's father from Akita in Northern Japan, and is the sole source of income. He met Misae at the age of 29 and after making her pregnant with Shin, the two wed. He is a loving father to his two children, and ultimately a devoted husband. While he is the family bread-winner, he hands the reins of finance over to his wife, who maintains a totalitarian level of control on family spending. At age 35, he is a stereotypical Japanese salaryman, working eight-hour days, enduring overstuffed trains, enjoying the occasional nightlife, and giving every bit of his take home pay to his wife every month. While his relationship with his family is positive on the whole, there is an abundance of recurring conflict. He and his wife bicker on many different things, from how little he gets for spending money every month, to whose turn it is to give the baby a bath. Misae is also notorious for inflicting violence on Hiroshi whenever she gets very angry (usually when his gaze wanders to younger women). He often dreams about being a playboy while he sleeps as an escape, though this is usually interrupted by some external stimulation. He enjoys a playful relationship with his children; but sometimes they're the source of his problems. He loves a cold beer after work and shares Shin-chan's appreciation of TV shows with young women in skimpy clothing, often getting too excited about it for Misae's liking. He will not hesitate to save his allowance for things he wants, but can be seen spending much of it on things for family. A running joke is made of the pungent odor of his feet and his socks are often used as weapons by other members of the family. He was born in Omagari, Akita (a village in Daisen, Akita).
